# space_snake
This projet aims to develop an AI using reinformcement learning to play a snake game.
The project is based as well on a Entity Component System architecture to try it out 

## Status
The architecture is set, the visual and the reinforcement learning logic too.
However, the reinforcement learning does not yield the expected results (agent going on circle or on straight line). 
Probably due to some design issues on the problem modelization. (too vast, wrong world representation, ...)
